personal notes:
to run needed python 3.11.* where normally i have 3.12.* by default

so needed to brew install the following
brew install pyenv
brew install pyenv-virtualenv

then needed to use virtualenv instead of my usual venv way
so 
pyenv init ( once off and put the results in the .zsh file)
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.7 envname ( this is stored not local in the project so need to be more specific with the names)
then use the cli help of pyenv to figure out the rest
